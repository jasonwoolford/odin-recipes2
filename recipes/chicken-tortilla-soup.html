<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine whole chicken, 1 onion, cilantro stems, bay leaves, oregano, peppercorns, dried chili pods, and 3 quarts in a large soup pot on medium-high heat.  Bring to simmer, then lower heat to medium-low, let simmer for 1 hour.</li>
        
        <p><b>Tortilla strip instructions:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>If making tortilla strips at home: Preheat an oven to 350°F/180°C, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or a silicone mat if preferable.</li>
                <li>Cut tortillas in half, then crosswise in 1/4" strips; transfer tortilla strips to the prepared baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Add salt and toss well to coat, then spread strips out evenly.</li>
                <li>Bake until crispy or golden brown, tossing once or twice during the 30 minute cook time.</li>
            </ol>

        <br>

        <li>With caution, remove chicken from the simmering pot, and place it into a seperate bowl.  Reduce the heat on the simmering broth to low.</li>
        <li>Let chicken cool so that the meat can be safely pulled away from the chicken, shred and refridgerate the chicken until needed.</li>
        <li>Add chicken bones, skin, and scraps to the broth, simmer on low heat for an additional 4 hours.  Water may be added to broth if it reduces too much during this time.</li>
        
        <p><b>Salsa instructions:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>After two hours of further simmering the broth, preheat the oven's broiler for high heat and set a rack about 8 inches below the heating element.</li>
                <li>Line a baking sheet with foil, and oil lightly. Place two onions, tomatoes, sweet red pepper, and jalapeno pepper onto sheet.</li>
                <li>Broil vegetables until charred, 7 to 10 minutes.  Add charred vegetables to a blender with garlic cloves, chipotle pepper, and 1 cup water, blend until smooth</li>
                <li>Pour salsa puree into the pot, raise heat to medium-low. Simmer broth for another 2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            </ol>

        <br>

        <li>Following the four hours of simmering, pass soup through a fine-mesh strainer into a seperate pot, squeezing the chicken to strain chicken juices into the new pot; discard bones and skin in strainer, and season the soup to taste.</li>
        <li>Add cumin, shredded chicken and juice from 1 lime.  Simmer 15 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Taste for seasoning, and serve with crispy tortilla strips.  Garnish with sour cream, avocado, cilantro, Mexican cheese, additional lime juice, and a dash of cayenne, if desired.</li>
